# I-Translate

I-Translate is an innovative software solution developed to strengthen **Social Defence** in Singapore by overcoming communication barriers faced by the elderly and hearing-impaired communities. In a diverse, multi-racial, and multi-lingual society like Singapore, fostering understanding and connection among different communities is crucial for peace, progress, and resilience. I-Translate helps bridge language and communication gaps between elderly residents who speak various dialects and volunteers or caregivers who primarily speak English, as well as between hearing-impaired individuals and the broader community.

## Introduction

In Singapore's multi-cultural society, **Social Defence** involves building trust, understanding, and harmony among people of different races, languages, and backgrounds. However, vulnerable groups, such as the elderly who only speak dialects like Hokkien, Cantonese, or Hakka, often face language barriers that limit their participation in community networks and access to essential services. Similarly, hearing-impaired individuals encounter challenges in daily communication, leading to social isolation.

**I-Translate** aims to address these challenges by providing a seamless communication tool that empowers volunteers, caregivers, and community members to interact more effectively with these groups. By breaking down language barriers and enabling smoother communication, I-Translate contributes to the larger goal of Social Defenceâ€”ensuring that all Singaporeans, regardless of language or physical ability, are included, understood, and supported, especially during times of crisis.
